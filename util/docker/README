Build a grideye_agent docker image.

Example usage:

First, build the Docker image using the Dockerfile in this direcotyr:
 $ docker build .

If everything built without errors, start the newly built image with:
 $ docker run -it -e GRIDEYE_URL=<URL> -e <UUID> -e GRIDEYE_NAME=<name> <image>

The grideye-agent will automatically be started when the Docker image
runs and UDP port 7878 will be exposed.
